Seven years ago, I published a post on Medium called **["From Silicon Allee to Silicon Valley”](https://medium.com/@sinisa.mikulic/from-silicon-allee-to-silicon-valley-e628d5845b34)**. In it, I shared my journey moving from Croatia to Berlin, diving into the city’s startup scene, and later experiencing the contrast of Silicon Valley interviews.

That post captured a moment in time: Berlin was casual and fast-moving, Silicon Valley was algorithm-heavy and structured, and I was just starting to see how differently companies approached hiring engineers.

Seven years later, I’m revisiting those thoughts to reflect on what has changed in startup hiring.

<br />
### Berlin was casual, fast, and human

*They couldn’t care less about my algorithm skills!*

Which summed up Berlin startup hiring perfectly. Most of my interviews back then were coffee chats with founders or CTOs, and we talked more about real product challenges, and less about LeetCode.
If we agreed on the best kebab in the city and I could help them with their next milestone, we worked together. Inverting a binary tree from memory didn't matter as much.

<br />
### Silicon Valley was focused on algorithms and over-screening

*A lot of the filtering is done with algorithm challenges. Other factors, such as team fit, or understanding how the developer can contribute to the project aren’t considered early on.*

That was my reality breaking into the San Francisco tech scene. Before speaking to anyone on the actual team, I’d often face multiple rounds of algorithm screens. The human side and whether I could actually help the product, came much later, if at all.

<br />
### How things changed in Europe and the US

In the past seven years, I’ve had the chance to work with startups in Berlin, San Francisco, and across Europe and the US. I've worked as a remote contractor, consultant, team lead, and engineer, and the hiring patterns have been clear.

**Europe has matured.** Interviews are more structured, processes more formal, and HR often steps in earlier. But compared to the US, hiring is still more pragmatic and product-focused. [Industry observers also note this](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-reality-of-tech-interviews).

**In the US, especially after the remote shift, filtering has gotten stricter**. Many companies lean harder on technical challenges because they need to “screen at scale.” The result: more hoops for candidates, but also more applicants to filter.

<br />
### The rise of AI in hiring

*Ironically enough, one startup that wasn’t too happy with my performance had the most intense technical screening and the most algorithm heavy home task!*

That irony feels sharper than ever today. The toughest, most abstract screenings still don’t guarantee great hires and now AI has made the problem bigger.
Today, AI can solve most algorithm challenges better than humans. Which means your AI-generated screening test may just be competing against a candidate’s AI-generated solution. That’s a game with no winners.

**For founders, the risk is obvious:** you waste weeks hiring someone who aced the technical challenge, only to find they struggle with the messy, unstructured reality of building a product.

What AI can’t do is show product intuition, empathy for users and your team, or the ability to communicate well when things are unclear.

<br />
### What Founders Should Take Away in 2025

If you’re an early-stage founder hiring engineers today, here’s the key lesson I’ve learned after more than 10 years of building products in Europe and the US:

- **Rigid technical screens don't prove product sense.**
- **Great startup engineers are builders first.**
- **The best hires are the ones who help you ship, learn, and adapt fast.**
- **Instead of another technical screen, try a 30-minute product discussion or portfolio review where you’ll learn more about how someone thinks.**

<p class="prominent">Berlin’s casual interviews and Silicon Valley’s rigorous filters both have lessons. But if you’re hiring in 2025, the sweet spot is clear: **hire people who think about users, own product areas, and deliver without hand-holding.**</p>

### Closing thought

These lessons still shape how I work today. I’ve seen the risks of over-engineering the hiring process, and I’ve also seen how much momentum startups gain when they bring in builders who care about outcomes.
Whether I’m leading a frontend effort or advising a founder, I focus less on abstract tests and more on the only question that matters — *how can we ship something valuable, fast?*
