        When I joined the team was in their pre-revenue stage with seed funding
        round, and my roles was to:
        <ul>
          <li>improve development team feature delivery speed</li>
          <li>increase estimation accuracy</li>
          <li>help with key features for growth of the company and product</li>

      <b>1. Added key features towards our product stability and value</b>
      <p>
        Payment processing
        <br />- enabled our <b>revenue stream</b> and Plaid integration
        <br />- added <b>International payments</b> functionality

        More granular approach to building components
        <br />- increased our development velocity and cross-team understanding
        of the code that reduced "knowledge silos"
      </p>
      <b>2. Changed team communication</b>
      <p>
        By having weekly team sync we managed to establish certain engineering
        standards that helped out our code review process significantly.
        <br />
        We started documeting our best practices and created a technical roadmap
        that would guide our decision making process and ensure code quality.
      </p>
      <b>3. Pushed for engineers to own product feature discovery process</b>
      <p>
        By assigning specific feature owner we enabled engineers to ask the
        right questions and discover potential risks to development ahead of
        time. This role also provided a "hub" person who had the most context
        relevant for that specific feature.
        <br />
        We started giving relevant feedback to our product managers in order to
        reduce the scope of potential "rabbit holes" or split the feature into
        MVP and Nice To Have items.
