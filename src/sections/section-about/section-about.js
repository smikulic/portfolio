        My name is Sinisa. After my degree in IT, I began developing web applications for local businesses. 
        In 2012, I started a Boutique Web Development shop with my two friends and I was happy to work long into the night learning more about what I loved. 
        My years of dedication and experience coupled with my passion for technology and business allow me to truly enjoy the work that I do.

      <p>
        Various experience throughout Berlin startups has brought me to one of the highly successfull companies in San Francisco 
        where I strived as a software engineer.

        My personal preference for remote work has prevailed and had brough me back home mid 2019 where I quickly launched a small 
        Web Consultancy business - Code Well Studio - and now looking forward to provide my extensive experience to you!
