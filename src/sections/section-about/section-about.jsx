        My name is Sinisa. After my degree in IT, I began developing web
        applications for local businesses. In 2012, I started a Boutique Web
        Development shop with my two friends and I was happy to work long into
        the night learning more about what I loved. My years of dedication and
        experience coupled with my passion for technology and business allow me
        to truly enjoy the work that I do.

        Various experience throughout Berlin startups has brought me to one of
        the highly successfull companies in San Francisco where I strived as a
        software engineer.

        My personal preference for remote work has prevailed and had brough me
        back home mid 2019 where I quickly launched a small Web Consultancy
        business - Code Well Studio - and now looking forward to provide my
        extensive experience to you!
