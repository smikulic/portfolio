        <b>solarisBank enables other businesses to offer fully digital and fully compliant 
        financial services to their end-customer</b>. solarisBank is a pioneer in offering 
        banking as a service, which meant they had tremendous challenges on technical side.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their vision was spanning into having the real-time interface providing our 
        operations team transparency and supervision into our business. 
        But soon after we saw the <b>opportunity to change the perception of banking software</b>. 
        We were working directly under the CTO and quickly developed a roadmap which included 
        a daunting task of externalizing our interface as a <b>white-label product!</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        We were spearheading the product development, hiring and onboarding more 
        front end engineers to help out with the challenge at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Main obstacle was building features and keeping up with the heavily resourced backend teams 
        while starting a brand new product and its technical architecture.

      <p>
        To overcome these issues, our team had to become a <b>Swiss Army knife</b> of solarisBank. 
        We developed our very own framework for adding entire CRUD endpoints in a 
        matters of hours, fully tested and production ready, as opposed to couple of days. 
        That framework also enabled new engineers to get up to speed in a matter of weeks, 
        rather than months.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Features that used to take up to three days to develop could now be done within three to four hours.</b></li>
        <li><b>New engineers that needed 6-8 weeks to get up to speed, now need less than 2 weeks.</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For a company that was growing rapidly, and strained with resources, 
        our technical solution quickly turned into a very monetizable product. 
        It proved that you donâ€™t always need a lot of engineers, but a few well thought out ideas, 
        and skills to implement them.
      </p>
      <p className="prominent">
        Since our tools was also used in promotional and demo purposes, 
        <b>solarisBank's customer base have grown 10x and acquisition speed increased significantly!</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When the project was finished, we had more than that to showcase. Overall team happiness
        was skyrocketing, development, performance and customer acquisition speed increased drastically.
      </p>
      <p>
        After one year, we checked back to see how the product is doing, 
        and found out that the <b>code and architecture developed is being used as a 
        core component in scaling new products</b>, and the <b>front end team is 
        still the most efficient team!</b>
